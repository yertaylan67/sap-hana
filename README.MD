# Automated SAP Deployments in Azure Cloud <!-- omit in toc -->

Master Branch's status: [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/azuresaphana/Azure-SAP-HANA/_apis/build/status/Azure.sap-hana?branchName=master&api-version=5.1-preview.1)](https://dev.azure.com/azuresaphana/Azure-SAP-HANA/_build/latest?definitionId=6&branchName=master)

This repository contains code that can be used to automatically deploy SAP landscapes in the Azure Cloud.

The templates are split into:
- **Terraform modules**
which deploy the infrastructure components (such as VMs, network, storage) in Azure.
- **Ansible playbooks**
which run different roles to configure and VMs and install SAP HANA and required applications on the already deployed infrastructure.
